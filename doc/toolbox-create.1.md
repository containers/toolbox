## NAME
toolbox\-create - Create a new Toolbx container

## SYNOPSIS
**toolbox create** [*--authfile FILE*]
               [*--distro DISTRO* | *-d DISTRO*]
               [*--image NAME* | *-i NAME*]
               [*--release RELEASE* | *-r RELEASE*]
               [*--build BUILDCONTEXT* | *-b BUILDCONTEXT*]
               [*--build-tag TAG* | *-t TAG*]
               [*CONTAINER*]

## DESCRIPTION

Creates a new Toolbx container. You can then use the `toolbox enter` command
to interact with the container at any point.

A Toolbx container is an OCI container created from an OCI image. On Fedora,
the default image is known as `fedora-toolbox:N`, where N is the release of
the host. If the image is not present locally, then it is pulled from a
well-known registry like `registry.fedoraproject.org`. Other images may be
used on other host operating systems. If the host is not recognized, then the
Fedora image will be used.

The container is created with `podman create`, and its entry point is set to
`toolbox init-container`.

By default, a Toolbx container is named after its corresponding image. If the
image had a tag, then the tag is included in the name of the container, but
it's separated by a hyphen, not a colon. A different name can be assigned by
using the CONTAINER argument.

### Container Configuration

A Toolbx container seamlessly integrates with the rest of the operating
system by providing access to the user's home directory, the Wayland and X11
sockets, networking (including Avahi), removable devices (like USB sticks),
systemd journal, SSH agent, D-Bus, ulimits, /dev and the udev database, etc..

The user ID and account details from the host is propagated into the Toolbx
container, SELinux label separation is disabled, and the host file system can
be accessed by the container at /run/host. The container has access to the
host's Kerberos credentials cache if it's configured to use KCM caches.

A Toolbx container can be identified by the `com.github.containers.toolbox`
label or the `/run/.toolboxenv` file.

The entry point of a Toolbx container is the `toolbox init-container` command
which plays a role in setting up the container, along with the options passed
to `podman create`.

### Entry Point

A key feature of Toolbx containers is their entry point, the `toolbox
init-container` command.

OCI containers are inherently immutable. Configuration options passed through
`podman create` are baked into the definition of the OCI container, and can't
be changed later. This means that changes and improvements made in newer
versions of Toolbx can't be applied to pre-existing Toolbx containers
created by older versions of Toolbx. This is avoided by using the entry point
to configure the container at runtime.

The entry point of a Toolbx container customizes the container to fit the
current user by ensuring that it has a user that matches the one on the host,
and grants it `sudo` and `root` access.

Crucial configuration files, such as `/etc/host.conf`, `/etc/hosts`,
`/etc/localtime`, `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/timezone`, inside the container
are kept synchronized with the host. The entry point also bind mounts various
subsets of the host's file system hierarchy to their corresponding locations
inside the container to provide seamless integration with the host. This
includes `/run/libvirt`, `/run/systemd/journal`, `/run/udev/data`,
`/var/lib/libvirt`, `/var/lib/systemd/coredump`, `/var/log/journal` and others.

On some host operating systems, important paths like `/home`, `/media` or
`/mnt` are symbolic links to other locations. The entry point ensures that
paths inside the container match those on the host, to avoid needless
confusion.

## OPTIONS ##

**--authfile** FILE

Path to a FILE with credentials for authenticating to the registry for private
images. The FILE is usually set using `podman login`, and will be used by
`podman pull` to get the image.

The default location for FILE is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json` and
its format is specified in `containers-auth.json(5)`.

**--distro** DISTRO, **-d** DISTRO

Create a Toolbx container for a different operating system DISTRO than the
host. Cannot be used with `--image`. Has to be coupled with `--release` unless
the selected DISTRO matches the host.

**--image** NAME, **-i** NAME

Change the NAME of the image used to create the Toolbx container. This is
useful for creating containers from custom-built images. Cannot be used with
`--distro` and `--release`.

If NAME does not contain a registry, the local image storage will be
consulted, and if it's not present there then it will be pulled from a suitable
remote registry.

**--release** RELEASE, **-r** RELEASE

Create a Toolbx container for a different operating system RELEASE than the
host. Cannot be used with `--image`.

**--build** BUILDCONTEXT, **-b** BUILDCONTEXT

Build a toolbx image from the build context found at BUILDCONTEXT by passing it
to `podman build`. Afterwards it sets the tag to `localhost/<name of the image>`
by extracting the name from the image and then creates the container like normal.

You cannot use `--distro`, `--release` or `--image` together with this option.

**--build-tag** TAG, **-t** TAG

Overwrites the tagging behaviour of `--build` by tagging the image with TAG via
`podman build --tag`. If no repository if given or podman doesn't know it,
localhost is used.

Can only be used when `--build` is also used.

## EXAMPLES

### Create the default Toolbx container matching the host OS

```
$ toolbox create
```

### Create the default Toolbx container for Fedora 36

```
$ toolbox create --distro fedora --release f36
```

### Create a custom Toolbx container from a custom image

```
$ toolbox create --image bar foo
```

### Create a custom Toolbx container from a custom image that's private

```
$ toolbox create --authfile ~/auth.json --image registry.example.com/bar
```
