[Toolbox](https://github.com/containers/toolbox) is a tool for Linux operating
systems, which allows the use of containerized command line environments. It is
built on top of [Podman](https://podman.io/) and other standard container
technologies from [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/).

This is particularly useful on
[OSTree](https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) based operating systems like
[Fedora CoreOS](https://coreos.fedoraproject.org/) and
[Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/). The intention of these
systems is to discourage installation of software on the host, and instead
install software as (or in) containers — they mostly don't even have package
managers like DNF or YUM. This makes it difficult to set up a development
environment or install tools for debugging in the usual way.

Toolbox solves this problem by providing a fully mutable container within
which one can install their favourite development and debugging tools, editors
and SDKs. For example, it's possible to do `yum install ansible` without
affecting the base operating system.

However, this tool doesn't *require* using an OSTree based system. It works
equally well on Fedora Workstation and Server, and that's a useful way to
incrementally adopt containerization.

The toolbox environment is based on an [OCI](https://www.opencontainers.org/)
image. On Fedora this is the `fedora-toolbox` image. This image is used to
create a toolbox container that seamlessly integrates with the rest of the
operating system by providing access to the user's home directory, the Wayland
and X11 sockets, SSH agent, etc..

## Installation

Toolbox is installed by default on Fedora Silverblue. On other operating
systems it's just a matter of installing the `toolbox` package.

## Usage

### Create your toolbox container:
```console
[user@hostname ~]$ toolbox create
Created container: fedora-toolbox-33
Enter with: toolbox enter
[user@hostname ~]$
```
This will create a container called `fedora-toolbox-<version-id>`.

### Enter the toolbox:
```console
[user@hostname ~]$ toolbox enter
⬢[user@toolbox ~]$
```

### Remove a toolbox container:
```console
[user@hostname ~]$ toolbox rm fedora-toolbox-33
[user@hostname ~]$
```

## Dependencies and Building

Toolbox requires at least Podman 1.4.0 to work, and uses the Meson build
system.

The following dependencies are required to build it:
- meson
- go-md2man
- systemd
- go
- ninja

The following dependencies enable various optional features:
- bash-completion

It can be built and installed as any other typical Meson-based project:
```console
[user@hostname toolbox]$ meson -Dprofile_dir=/etc/profile.d builddir
[user@hostname toolbox]$ ninja -C builddir
[user@hostname toolbox]$ sudo ninja -C builddir install
```

Toolbox is written in Go. Consult the
[src/go.mod](https://github.com/containers/toolbox/blob/master/src/go.mod) file
for a full list of all the Go dependencies.

By default, Toolbox uses Go modules and all the required Go packages are
automatically downloaded as part of the build. There's no need to worry about
the Go dependencies, unless the build environment doesn't have network access
or any such peculiarities.

## Distro support

By default, Toolbox creates the container using an
[OCI](https://www.opencontainers.org/) image called
`<ID>-toolbox:<VERSION-ID>`, where `<ID>` and `<VERSION-ID>` are taken from the
host's `/usr/lib/os-release`. For example, the default image on a Fedora 33
host would be `fedora-toolbox:33`.

This default can be overridden by the `--image` option in `toolbox create`,
but operating system distributors should provide an adequately configured
default image to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Image requirements

Toolbox customizes newly created containers in a certain way. This requires
certain tools and paths to be present and have certain characteristics inside
the OCI image.

Tools:
* `getent(1)`
* `id(1)`
* `ln(1)`
* `mkdir(1)`: for hosts where `/home` is a symbolic link to `/var/home`
* `passwd(1)`
* `readlink(1)`
* `rm(1)`
* `rmdir(1)`: for hosts where `/home` is a symbolic link to `/var/home`
* `sleep(1)`
* `test(1)`
* `touch(1)`
* `unlink(1)`
* `useradd(8)`
* `usermod(8)`

Paths:
* `/etc/host.conf`: optional, if present not a bind mount
* `/etc/hosts`: optional, if present not a bind mount
* `/etc/krb5.conf.d`: directory, not a bind mount
* `/etc/localtime`: optional, if present not a bind mount
* `/etc/resolv.conf`: optional, if present not a bind mount
* `/etc/timezone`: optional, if present not a bind mount

Toolbox enables `sudo(8)` access inside containers. The following is necessary
for that to work:

* The image should have `sudo(8)` enabled for users belonging to either the
  `sudo` or `wheel` groups, and the group itself should exist. File an
  [issue](https://github.com/containers/toolbox/issues/new) if you really need
  support for a different group. However, it's preferable to keep this list as
  short as possible.

* The image should allow empty passwords for `sudo(8)`. This can be achieved
  by either adding the `nullok` option to the `PAM(8)` configuration, or by
  add the `NOPASSWD` tag to the `sudoers(5)` configuration.

Since Toolbox only works with OCI images that fulfill certain requirements,
it will refuse images that aren't tagged with
`com.github.containers.toolbox="true"` and
`com.github.debarshiray.toolbox="true"` labels. These labels are meant to be
used by the maintainer of the image to indicate that they have read this
document and tested that the image works with Toolbox. You can use the
following snippet in a Dockerfile for this:
```Dockerfile
LABEL com.github.containers.toolbox="true" \
      com.github.debarshiray.toolbox="true"
```
