### Security fixes

* Bumped the minimum github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2 version to 2.4.0 for
  GHSA-2464-8j7c-4cjm

### Bug fixes

* Deprecated all containers that need the org.freedesktop.Flatpak.SessionHelper
  D-Bus interface to keep /etc/localtime and /etc/timezone synchronized with
  the host
* Started using a configuration file for the 'p11-kit server' socket on the
  host, used to access the CA certificates, with p11-kit >= 0.25.6.  Older
  p11-kit versions will continue to work using the P11_KIT_SERVER_ADDRESS
  environment variable.
* Unbroke access to CA certificates in su(1) and sudo(8) sessions (regression
  in 0.1.2)

### Tests

* Fixed the DNS resolver written in Python, used by the runtime environment
  tests for networking, to correctly request IPv4 addresses
* Made the the commands and options tests stricter

===

### Security fixes

* Bumped the minimum github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2 version to 2.3.0 for
  GHSA-fv92-fjc5-jj9h or GO-2025-3787
* Bumped the minimum github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit version to
  1.17.8 for CVE-2025-23266 and CVE-2025-23267

### Bug fixes

* Improved error handling when creating symbolic links inside the container
  to initialize it
* Preserved environment variables set by a KDE session and Konsole
* Unbroke access to CA certificates in sshd(8) sessions (regression in 0.1.2)
* Unbroke overriding the HOME variable (regression in 0.0.90)

### Dependencies

* Bumped the minimum Go version to 1.22

### Tests

* Enabled the runtime environment tests for the Container Device Interface
  specification and resource limits on Ubuntu 22.04
* Isolated the host's HOME from the system tests
* Unbroke the missing subordinate ID ranges (regression in Fedora Rawhide)

  Rawhide)


0.1.2
=====

### Security fixes

* Bumped the minimum github.com/briandowns/spinner version to 1.23.2 for
  CVE-2022-29526 or GHSA-p782-xgp4-8hr8, and other bug fixes
* Bumped the minimum github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit version to
  1.17.4 for CVE-2024-0134 or GHSA-7jm9-xpwx-v999, CVE-2024-0135 or
  GHSA-9v84-cc9j-pxr6, CVE-2024-0136 or GHSA-vcfp-63cx-4h59, CVE-2024-0137 or
  GHSA-frhw-w3wm-6cw4, and CVE-2025-23359 or GHSA-4hmh-pm5p-9j7j

### Enhancements

* Added ubuntu-toolbox image definitions for Ubuntu 25.04
* Gave access to the CA certificates from the host operating system — requires
  new Toolbx images and 'p11-kit server' on the host.  Note that the UBI-based
  images for RHEL haven't yet been updated, and this feature is currently
  disabled for those containers.

### Bug fixes

* Optimized getting the runtime directory
* Replaced links to the code repository with the website
* Updated fallback release to 42 for non-fedora hosts

### Dependencies

* Added a new weak dependency on 'p11-kit server'
* Bumped the minimum github.com/NVIDIA/go-nvlib version to 0.7.1
* Bumped the minimum github.com/spf13/viper version to 1.20.1 to reduce the
  number of indirect dependencies
* Bumped the minimum github.com/stretchr/testify version to 1.10.0
* Bumped the minimum Go version to 1.21

### Tests

* Added runtime environment tests for the Kerberos and RPM configuration
* Added unit tests for utils.PathExists()
* Dropped the PODMAN and SKOPEO environment variables
* Enabled the commands and options tests for 'list' on Arch and Ubuntu 22.04
* Enabled the system tests for 'create' and networking on Arch Linux
* Isolated the storage directory from the host's XDG_CACHE_HOME or HOME —
  bumped the minimum Linux kernel version to 6.6
* Made the the commands and options tests for 'create' stricter
* Optimized the runtime environment tests by avoiding a lot of disk I/O
* Restored the generation and installation of the Bash completions on the CI
  (regression from Fedora 41)
