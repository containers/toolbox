# System tests

These tests are built with BATS (Bash Automated Testing System). They are
strongly influenced by libpod project.

The tests are meant to ensure that toolbox's functionality remains stable
throughout updates of both Toolbox and Podman/libpod.

## Structure

- **Basic Tests**
  - [] output version number (Toolbox + Podman)
  - [x] show help screen when no command is given
  - [x] create the default container
  - [x] create a container with a custom name
  - [x] create a container from a custom image
  - [x] list containers (no present)
  - [x] list default container and default image
  - [x] list containers (some present; different name patterns)
  - [x] list images (no present)
  - [x] list images (some present; different name patterns)
  - [x] remove a specific container
  - [x] try to remove nonexistent container
  - [x] try to remove a running container
  - [x] remove all containers
  - [x] try to remove all containers (running)
  - [x] remove a specific image
  - [x] remove all images
  - [x] run a command inside of an existing container

- **Advanced Tests**
  - [ ] create several containers with various configuration and then list them
  - [ ] create several containers and hop between them (series of enter/exit)
  - [ ] create a container, enter it, run a series of basic commands (id,
        whoami, dnf, top, systemctl,..)
  - [ ] enter a container and test basic set of networking tools (ping,
        traceroute,..)

The list of tests is stil rather basic. We **welcome** PRs with test
suggestions or even their implementation.

## Convention

- All tests that start with *Try to..* expect non-zero return value.

## How to run the tests

Make sure you have `bats` and `podman` with `toolbox` installed on your system.

- Enter the toolbox root folder
- Invoke command `bats ./test/system/` and the test suite should fire up

By default the test suite uses the system versions of `podman` and `toolbox`.

If you have a `podman` or `toolbox` installed in a nonstandard location then
you can use the `PODMAN` and `TOOLBOX` environmental variables to set the path
to the binaries. So the command to invoke the test suite could look something
like this: `PODMAN=/usr/libexec/podman TOOLBOX=./toolbox bats ./test/system/`.
