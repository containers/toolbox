# System tests

These tests are built with BATS (Bash Automated Testing System).

The tests are meant to ensure that Toolbox's functionality remains stable
throughout updates of both Toolbox and Podman/libpod.

The tests are set up in a way that does not affect the host environment.
Running them won't remove any existing containers or images.

## Dependencies

- `awk`
- `bats`
- `GNU coreutils`
- `podman`
- `skopeo`
- `toolbox`

These tests use a few standard libraries for `bats` which help with clarity
and consistency. The libraries are [bats-support](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support)
and [bats-assert](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-assert). These libraries are
provided as git submodules in the `libs` directory. Make sure both are present.

## How to run the tests

First, make sure you have all the dependencies installed.

- Enter the toolbox root folder
- Invoke command `bats ./test/system/` and the test suite should fire up

Mocking of images is done automatically to prevent potential networking issues
and to speed up the cases.

By default the test suite uses the system versions of `podman`, `skopeo` and
`toolbox`.

If you have a `podman`, `skopeo` or `toolbox` installed in a nonstandard
location then you can use the `PODMAN`, `SKOPEO` and `TOOLBOX` environmental
variables to set the path to the binaries. So the command to invoke the test
suite could look something like this: `PODMAN=/usr/libexec/podman TOOLBOX=./toolbox bats ./test/system/`.

When running the tests, make sure the `test suite: [job]` jobs are successful.
These jobs set up the whole environment and are a strict requirement for other
jobs to run correctly.

## Writing tests

### Naming convention

- All tests should follow the nomenclature: `[command]: <test description>...`
- When the test is expected to fail, start the test description with "Try
  to..."
- When the test is to give a non obvious output, it should be put in parenthesis
  at the end of the title

Examples:

* `@test "create: Create the default container"`
* `@test "rm: Try to remove a non-existent container"`

### Test case environment

- All the tests start with a clean system (no images or containers) to make sure
  that there are no dependencies between tests and they are really isolated. Use
  the `setup()` and `teardown()` functions for that purpose.
